# Data-Mining-and-ML
K-means clustering, MLP, SVM and Ensemble learning using R programming language. 

There are three parts:

The first part includes K-means clustering analysis using wine dataset. There are number of pre-processing tasks completed before the number of clusters are selected to perform k-means clustering analysis. 

The second and third part looks at MLP and SVM modelling concepts through the implementation of algorithms using time-series ExchangeUSD dataset. The performance of the internal network structure used in both the models is quantified using statistical indices (RMSE, MAE and MAPE). A comparison table is drawn highlighting the performance of distinctive appropriate input vector, hidden layers, nodes and learning rate used in each model.

I am still learning would really appreciate your invaluable advice.
